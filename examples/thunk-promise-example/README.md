# [Retux Redux-Thunk and Redux-Promise Example](https://github.com/crimx/retux/tree/master/examples/thunk-promise-example)

This example shows the ability of mixing other action types in Retux while still maintaining strongly-typed.

This project template was built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), which provides a simple way to start React projects with no build configuration needed.
